# HTAN Data Portal
This repo contains the code for the [Human Tumor Atlas Network Data Portal](https://humantumoratlas.org/)

## Framework
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Backend
All data is coming from [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/). We have a Python script that generates a JSON file that contains all the metadata. There is currently no backend, it's a fully static site i.e. all filtering happens on the frontend.

### Update Data Files

```
cd data
# Run the script that pulls all the HTAN metadata
# It outputs a JSON in public/syn_data.json and a JSON with links to metadata in data/syn_metadata.json
python get_syn_data.py
# Replace BulkWES -> BulkDNA-seq (this is a temp fix)
gsed -i 's/BulkWES/BulkDNA-seq/g' ../public/syn_data.json && gsed -i 's/BulkWES/BulkDNA-seq/g' ../data/syn_metadata.json
cd ..
# Convert the resulting  JSON to a more efficient structure for visualization
./node_modules/.bin/ncc run data/processSynapseJSON.ts  --transpile-only
```

### Export to bucket
At the moment all data is hosted on S3 for producion. This is because there is a file size limit for vercel. To update it:

1. gzip file (note that it's already gzipped in the repo)
1. Remove ".gz" extension so it's just json and rename to include current date in filename.
3. Upload file to s3 bucket "htanfiles" (part of schultz AWS org)
4. The file needs two meta settings:  `Content-Encloding=gzip` and `Content-Type=application/json`
5. Once file is up, change path in
`/lib/helpers.ts`

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests, other than building the project, so be careful when merging to master

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing any page. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
